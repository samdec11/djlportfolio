    %h2 Artist Statement
    %p.bio I believe in aspiring.  That endeavor yields being; evinces the assertion of life; circumvents the caprice of society and culture.  Artâ€™s triumph is the vessel and fanfare of humanity; it rejects what binds and gestures us to the soul-sung loving in dream. The valence of experience reveals our starting, and the ever beginning molds our living.  Where is where when only we leap.
